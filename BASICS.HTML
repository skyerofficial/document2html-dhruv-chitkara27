The ﬁrst generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and there have been multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases since.<br /> The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks. <del>It supports android apps.</del><em> As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.</em><b> Apple has released ten generations of iPhone models,</b> each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the iOS operating system. It was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the <b>voice assistant Siri</b>. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a ﬁngerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. <br /><br /><code>They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays.<br /><br /> The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year,<br /> <br />which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs,<br /><br /> as well as the SE—which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S.<br /><br /></code> <u>In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,</u> which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. <i>The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID.</i><br />
